# Medusa
an open source cross-platform general purpose AI for making "black box" classifications of documents, images and more 

## What is Medusa?

Medusa is a business-focused general purpose AI. Medusa is like Watson, Siri or Alexa but made for business problems, "she" can price, categorize, rank, and predict across many data types (numbers, text, photo and video).

Our users are are companies with lots of data and complex problems to solve, some customers want to plug in an AI to help them sort resumes in HR, some want to price their assets, others need to categorize documents or flag videos. Medusa does it all.
