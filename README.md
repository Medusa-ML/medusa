# Medusa
an open source cross-platform general purpose AI for making "black box" classifications of documents, images and more 

## What is Medusa?

Medusa is a business-focused general purpose AI. Medusa is like Watson, Siri or Alexa but made for business problems, "she" can price, categorize, rank, and predict across many data types (numbers, text, photo and video).

Our users are are companies with lots of data and complex problems to solve, some customers want to plug in an AI to help them sort resumes in HR, some want to price their assets, others need to categorize documents or flag videos. Medusa does it all.

## Goals and Limitations

The goal of this project is to democratize and push forward the fronier of AI-powered tools for low-risk predictons.

Aims:
* Medusa aims for "80%" accuracy across models that predict "widely useful" metrics, and leaves fine model tuning to other projects or medusa forks.
* Medusa aims to be cross-platform, fast, and willing to take many forms of data
* Medusa aims to address the "Intelligent Personal Assistant" request on the [High Priority Projects List of the Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/personalassistant)

The Medusa team thinks this statement is silly...

> “I am telling you, the world’s first trillionaires are going to come from somebody who masters AI and all its derivatives and applies it in ways we never thought of” - Mark Cuban

We think that this statement typical of people who don't fit models for a living. Sure, ML models can make people oodles of money but cheap categorization and "80%" models like those that Medusa produces can move the ball forward for all businesses, and can be free. (If they weren't free they would be easy to copy, too)

DISCLAIMER: Given all of the statements above Medusa is not a GPAI looking to solve self-driving or life-and-death decisions for medicine.
